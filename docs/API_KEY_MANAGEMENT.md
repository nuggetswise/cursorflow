# V0 API Key Management & User Onboarding

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to V0 API key management and user onboarding for Magic Nuggetwise. Our goal is to make the setup process as simple and user-friendly as possible, especially for non-technical users.

**Note**: Unlike some competitors (like 21st.dev) who provide their own AI service, Magic Nuggetwise integrates directly with V0 AI, requiring users to provide their own V0 API key. This approach gives users full control over their V0 usage and costs.

## Core Principles

### User-Centric Design
- **One-Click Installation**: Users should be able to install Magic Nuggetwise with minimal technical knowledge
- **Guided Experience**: Step-by-step setup wizard to walk users through the process
- **Clear Communication**: User-friendly language and visual indicators
- **Helpful Error Messages**: Actionable guidance when things go wrong

### Direct V0 Integration
- **No Middleman**: Direct integration with V0 AI, no proprietary AI service
- **User Control**: Users provide their own V0 API keys and manage their own costs
- **Transparency**: Clear separation between our costs (LLM agents) and user costs (V0 API)
- **Trust**: Users maintain full control over their V0 account and usage

### Security First
- **Secure Storage**: API keys are stored securely in Cursor's environment
- **No Data Collection**: We never see or store user API keys
- **User Control**: Users can revoke their keys anytime at v0.dev
- **Transparent Usage**: Users can track their usage in their V0 dashboard

## User Onboarding Flow

### Primary Flow: One-Click Installation

**Step 1: Website Landing**
- User visits nuggetwise.com
- Sees clear value proposition and "Add to Cursor" button
- Understands what Magic Nuggetwise does and its benefits

**Step 2: One-Click Install**
- User clicks "Add to Cursor" button
- Cursor automatically opens with installation prompt
- User approves the installation
- Magic Nuggetwise MCP server is installed

**Step 3: First Command & Setup**
- User tries their first command: `/nuggetwise-v0/generate create a button`
- MCP server detects missing V0 API key
- Setup wizard responds with friendly instructions
- User configures API key in MCP settings (persistent across sessions)

**Step 4: Validation & Testing**
- System validates the API key with V0
- Auto-test with a simple component generation
- Success confirmation and next steps

**Step 5: Ready to Build**
- User can immediately start using Magic Nuggetwise
- Clear examples and commands provided
- Help system available for guidance

### Alternative Flow: Manual Setup

For advanced users who prefer manual setup:

**Step 1: Get V0 API Key**
- Visit v0.dev and sign up/login
- Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
- Create new API key and copy it

**Step 2: Configure MCP Server**
- In Cursor, go to Settings ‚Üí MCP
- Find the existing "nuggetwise-v0" server
- Add V0 API key to the "env" section:

\`\`\`json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nuggetwise-v0": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/singhm/cursorflow/packages/nw-mcp/dist/mcp-server.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "V0_API_KEY": "v1:YOUR_V0_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

üí° **Quick Setup:**
1. Open Cursor Settings ‚Üí MCP
2. Find the "nuggetwise-v0" server
3. Add this to the "env" section: `"V0_API_KEY": "v1:YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE"`
4. Replace `v1:YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE` with your V0 API key
5. Save and restart Cursor if needed

**Even Simpler:**
Just add this line to your existing nuggetwise-v0 server's "env" section:
```json
"V0_API_KEY": "v1:your-actual-v0-api-key-here"
```

**Step 3: Test Installation**
- Try generating a simple component
- Verify everything works correctly

## User Experience Elements

### Status Information (MCP Responses)

**API Key Status**
- Connected: "üîë API Key: Connected ‚úÖ" in command responses
- Disconnected: "üîë API Key: Not Connected ‚ùå" with setup instructions
- Clear guidance on how to connect

**Credits & Usage**
- V0 Credits remaining shown in command responses
- Daily and total component generation count
- Warning messages when credits are low

**System Status**
- Overall system health reported in command responses
- Connection status to V0
- Any pending updates or issues

### Guided Setup Wizard (MCP-Based)

**Implementation Approach:**
The setup wizard is implemented through the MCP server itself, not as a separate UI. When users first run a command without an API key, the MCP server provides an interactive setup experience through Cursor's chat interface.

**Welcome & Detection:**
- MCP server detects missing V0 API key on first command
- Returns friendly welcome message with setup instructions
- Provides clear next steps and estimated time

**Interactive Setup Flow:**
- User runs `/nuggetwise-v0/generate create a button`
- MCP server responds with setup guidance
- User configures API key in MCP settings (persistent across sessions)
- MCP server validates and uses the key
- Automatic test with simple component generation

**Setup Messages:**
