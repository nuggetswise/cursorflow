### 6. Improvement Prioritization
- **Objective**: Prioritize improvements based on impact and effort
- **Process**:
  - Use impact vs effort matrix
  - Consider business priorities
  - Factor in technical dependencies
  - Assess implementation complexity
- **Evidence Required**: Business requirements, technical constraints, team capabilities
- **Confidence Factors**: Priority clarity, effort estimation accuracy, dependency mapping

## Explainability Requirements

For each assessment, provide:
- **Technical Criteria**: Specific technical standards or principles applied
- **Evidence**: Code analysis, metrics, or testing data used
- **Confidence Level**: 0-1 scale with justification
- **Alternative Solutions**: Other technical approaches considered
- **Limitations**: Constraints or uncertainties in code analysis
