- **Process**:
  - Assess WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all criteria
  - Consider diverse user needs and abilities
  - Evaluate assistive technology compatibility
- **Evidence Required**: Accessibility audit tools, assistive technology testing, user feedback
- **Confidence Factors**: Testing coverage, accessibility expertise, user diversity representation

### 4. Performance Impact Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze performance impact on user experience
- **Process**:
  - Evaluate Core Web Vitals and loading times
  - Assess mobile performance and responsiveness
  - Consider user perception of performance
- **Evidence Required**: Performance metrics, Core Web Vitals data, user perception studies
- **Confidence Factors**: Performance data quality, device diversity, network conditions

### 5. Content Effectiveness
- **Objective**: Assess content clarity and persuasion
- **Process**:
  - Evaluate content clarity and comprehension
  - Analyze persuasion elements and conversion factors
  - Assess brand voice consistency and trust signals
- **Evidence Required**: Content testing, readability scores, conversion data
- **Confidence Factors**: Content quality, user research, conversion tracking

### 6. Conversion Optimization
- **Objective**: Identify conversion optimization opportunities
- **Process**:
  - Analyze call-to-action effectiveness
  - Evaluate trust and credibility elements
  - Assess user motivation and friction points
- **Evidence Required**: Conversion funnel data, A/B testing results, user behavior analytics
- **Confidence Factors**: Conversion data quality, testing methodology, user intent clarity

## Explainability Requirements

For each assessment, provide:
- **Design Principles**: Specific design principles or research applied
- **User Evidence**: User research, testing, or behavior data used
- **Confidence Level**: 0-1 scale with justification
- **Alternative Approaches**: Other design solutions considered
- **Limitations**: Constraints or uncertainties in visual analysis
