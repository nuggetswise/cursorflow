## Reasoning Framework

### 1. Business Problem Analysis
- **Objective**: Identify the core problem being solved
- **Process**: 
  - Analyze user pain points and market gaps
  - Evaluate business opportunity and market size
  - Consider competitive landscape and differentiation
- **Evidence Required**: Market research, user interviews, competitive analysis
- **Confidence Factors**: Data quality, market maturity, user feedback

### 2. Stakeholder Requirements Mapping
- **Objective**: Map all key stakeholders and their requirements
- **Process**:
  - Identify primary and secondary stakeholders
  - Document their needs, goals, and constraints
  - Prioritize requirements by impact and feasibility
- **Evidence Required**: Stakeholder interviews, business requirements, technical constraints
- **Confidence Factors**: Stakeholder availability, requirement clarity, alignment

### 3. Feature Prioritization (Impact vs Effort)
- **Objective**: Prioritize features using structured frameworks
- **Process**:
  - Use Impact vs Effort matrix (MoSCoW method)
  - Consider user value and business value
  - Factor in technical complexity and dependencies
- **Evidence Required**: User research, technical feasibility assessment, business impact analysis
- **Confidence Factors**: Data availability, estimation accuracy, stakeholder alignment

### 4. Technical Feasibility Assessment
- **Objective**: Evaluate technical implementation feasibility
- **Process**:
  - Assess current technical capabilities
  - Identify technical risks and dependencies
  - Consider scalability and performance requirements
- **Evidence Required**: Technical architecture review, team capabilities assessment, infrastructure analysis
- **Confidence Factors**: Technical expertise availability, architecture maturity, resource constraints

### 5. Success Metrics Definition (SMART)
- **Objective**: Define measurable success criteria
- **Process**:
  - Create SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) metrics
  - Align with business goals and user needs
  - Consider leading and lagging indicators
- **Evidence Required**: Business objectives, user behavior data, industry benchmarks
- **Confidence Factors**: Data availability, metric relevance, measurement capability

### 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation
- **Objective**: Identify and plan for potential risks
- **Process**:
  - Identify technical, business, and market risks
  - Assess probability and impact
  - Define mitigation strategies and contingency plans
- **Evidence Required**: Risk assessment frameworks, historical data, expert opinions
- **Confidence Factors**: Risk visibility, mitigation effectiveness, monitoring capability

## Explainability Requirements

For each major decision, provide:
- **Reasoning**: Clear explanation of why this decision was made
- **Evidence**: Specific data, research, or criteria used
- **Confidence Level**: 0-1 scale with justification
- **Alternatives**: Other approaches considered and why they weren't chosen
- **Limitations**: Constraints or uncertainties in the analysis
