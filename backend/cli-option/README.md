# CLI Option Documentation

This folder contains documentation and specifications for the **CLI (Command Line Interface) option** - a secondary approach to the CursorFlow platform.

## üéØ **Purpose**

The CLI option provides an alternative to the primary MCP-first approach for:
- **Power users** who prefer command-line workflows
- **Automation** and CI/CD integration
- **Advanced users** who need programmatic access
- **Future expansion** when CLI becomes more relevant

## üìÅ **Contents**

### **Documentation**
- **CLI_SPECS.md** - CLI command specifications and usage
- **CLI_INTEGRATION.md** - How CLI integrates with the platform
- **CLI_DEPLOYMENT.md** - CLI deployment and distribution
- **CLI_TESTING.md** - CLI testing strategies

### **Implementation**
- **CLI_ARCHITECTURE.md** - CLI system architecture
- **CLI_CONFIGURATION.md** - CLI configuration management
- **CLI_EXAMPLES.md** - Usage examples and tutorials

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**

**CLI is currently a secondary option and not actively developed.** The primary approach is **MCP-first** integration with Cursor IDE.

### **Current Status:**
- **MCP Integration**: ‚úÖ **ACTIVE** - Primary development focus
- **CLI Option**: üìã **PLANNED** - Secondary option for future

### **When to Use CLI:**
- **Automation workflows** requiring programmatic access
- **CI/CD pipelines** for automated PRD generation
- **Power users** who prefer command-line interfaces
- **Future scenarios** where CLI becomes more relevant

## üîÑ **Migration Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Documentation Separation** ‚úÖ
- Move CLI-related content from main docs to this folder
- Update references to point to CLI-specific documentation
- Maintain clear separation between MCP and CLI approaches

### **Phase 2: Implementation Separation** üìã
- Create separate CLI implementation when needed
- Maintain independent development cycles
- Share common backend services with MCP approach

### **Phase 3: Integration Strategy** üìã
- Define how CLI and MCP can work together
- Create unified configuration management
- Establish shared services and APIs

## üìö **Related Documentation**

- **Primary Approach**: `../dev-implementation/` - MCP-first implementation
- **Business Model**: `../business-product/` - Overall platform strategy
- **Architecture**: `../HYBRID_ARCHITECTURE.md` - System overview

*For the primary MCP-first approach, see the `../dev-implementation/` folder.* 

Great questions! Let me address both:

## **1. Updating the Files**

## **2. CLI Separation Strategy**

You're absolutely right! Since CLI is commented out and MCP is the primary approach, we should **separate CLI into its own folder**. Here's why and how:

### **üéØ Why Separate CLI?**

#### **Current Issues:**
- **Confusion**: "Hybrid" terminology suggests both approaches are equal
- **Clutter**: CLI code mixed with MCP-first documentation
- **Maintenance**: Hard to maintain when CLI is secondary
- **User Experience**: Developers get confused about which approach to use

#### **Benefits of Separation:**
- **Clear Focus**: MCP-first approach is crystal clear
- **Clean Documentation**: No mixed messaging
- **Future Flexibility**: CLI can be developed independently
- **Better Organization**: Logical separation of concerns

### **üìÅ Proposed CLI Separation Structure:**

```bash
mkdir -p implementation-plan/cli-option
```
Now let me identify which files contain CLI content that should be moved:

Perfect! Now I can see the scope. Let me create a comprehensive plan:

## **üìã CLI Separation Plan**

### **üéØ Files with CLI Content to Move:**

#### **1. API_SPECS.md** - **NEEDS CLEANING**
- Contains CLI approach types and endpoints
- Should keep MCP-first, move CLI to separate file

#### **2. V0_INTEGRATION_ENHANCED_PLAN.md** - **NEEDS CLEANING**
- Has CLI implementation sections
- Should focus on MCP, move CLI to separate file

#### **3. BACKEND_SPECS.md** - **NEEDS CLEANING**
- Contains CLI service implementations (commented out)
- Should keep MCP-first, move CLI to separate file

#### **4. INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - **NEEDS CLEANING**
- Has CLI integration sections
- Should focus on MCP, move CLI to separate file

#### **5. TESTING.md** - **NEEDS CLEANING**
- Contains CLI testing sections (commented out)
- Should keep MCP-first, move CLI to separate file

### **ÔøΩÔøΩ Recommended Action Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Create CLI Documentation Files**
1. **CLI_SPECS.md** - Extract CLI API specifications
2. **CLI_INTEGRATION.md** - Extract CLI integration details
3. **CLI_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Extract CLI architecture
4. **CLI_TESTING.md** - Extract CLI testing strategies

#### **Phase 2: Clean Main Documentation**
1. **Remove CLI references** from MCP-first files
2. **Update terminology** to be MCP-focused
3. **Add references** to CLI folder for secondary option

#### **Phase 3: Update References**
1. **Update README.md** to point to CLI folder
2. **Update file references** across documentation
3. **Maintain clear separation** between approaches

### **üéØ Benefits of This Approach:**

1. **Clear Focus**: MCP-first approach is unambiguous
2. **Future Flexibility**: CLI can be developed independently
3. **Better Organization**: Logical separation of concerns
4. **Reduced Confusion**: Developers know which approach to use
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain separate codebases

Would you like me to proceed with **Phase 1** - creating the CLI documentation files and extracting the CLI content from the main files?
