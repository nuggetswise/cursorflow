- **BACKEND_SPECS.md** - Backend architecture, services, and implementation details
- **HYBRID_ARCHITECTURE.md** - MCP-first system architecture and comprehensive overview (includes merged executive summary)

### **Development & Deployment**
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Deployment strategies, CI/CD, and infrastructure setup
- **CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive configuration management and environment setup (includes merged environment setup)
- **TESTING.md** - Testing strategies, unit tests, and QA processes

### **Integration & Implementation**
- **V0_INTEGRATION_ENHANCED_PLAN.md** - Enhanced V0 integration implementation plan
- **NUGGETWISE_BUILDER.md** - Nuggetwise builder technical implementation
- **INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Technical integration guide for all components
- **HYBRID_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Complete implementation roadmap with MCP-first alignment requirements (includes merged alignment checklist)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Start with `CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` to configure your development environment and set up all required variables
2. Review `HYBRID_ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the MCP-first system design and comprehensive overview
3. Use `API_SPECS.md` and `BACKEND_SPECS.md` for implementation details
4. Follow `V0_INTEGRATION_ENHANCED_PLAN.md` for V0 integration
5. Use `NUGGETWISE_BUILDER.md` for MCP server implementation
6. Follow `TESTING.md` for quality assurance
7. Use `DEPLOYMENT.md` for production deployment
8. Use `HYBRID_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` for complete implementation roadmap and alignment requirements
