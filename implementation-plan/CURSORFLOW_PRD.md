## üéØ Problem Statement

### **Primary Problem**
Product Managers spend 3-6 weeks creating PRDs, only to face another 8-12 weeks of development time. This creates a 4-6 month gap between idea conception and market validation, during which market conditions can change, competitors can emerge, and opportunities can be lost.

### **Secondary Problems**
1. **PRD Creation Bottleneck**: Manual PRD creation is time-consuming and often lacks technical depth
2. **Development Handoff Friction**: Communication gaps between PMs and developers lead to misinterpretations
3. **Quality Assurance Delays**: Manual code review and testing processes slow down deployment
4. **Local Development Setup**: Developers waste time on environment configuration
5. **Lack of AI Transparency**: Black-box AI systems create trust issues and reduce adoption

### **Market Impact**
- **Lost Revenue**: 60% of projects miss market windows due to development delays
- **Resource Waste**: 40% of development time spent on setup and configuration
- **Quality Issues**: 30% of features require rework due to unclear requirements
- **Team Frustration**: 70% of PMs report difficulty communicating technical requirements
